ONGC Ltd Share Price: Will ONGC Shares Rally Further or Face Resistance?
June 18, 2025





Crude oil is once again grabbing headlines, not just for its price movement, but for its geopolitical implications. As Brent crude nears $75 and WTI crosses $74 amid escalating tensions in the Middle East, upstream oil producers like the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) find themselves in the spotlight. Rising crude prices could lead to higher earnings for ONGC, potentially influencing the ongc ltd share price and investor sentiment.

But what does this really mean for investors tracking the ongc limited share price, and how does ONGC’s valuation stack up against historical performance? Let’s decode the latest developments and understand their implications.

‍


‍

Crude Oil Surge: A Boon for ONGC?
The crude oil market has been on edge due to the escalating Israel-Iran conflict. Iran’s threat to block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital artery for global oil shipping, has sparked supply concerns, triggering a spike in oil prices.

For upstream producers like ONGC, which earn revenue from crude extraction and sales, a price hike is good news. According to JM Financial, every $1 increase in crude price could boost ONGC’s earnings per share (EPS) by 1.5–2%. This directly supports the intrinsic value of ONGC, as rising profits improve valuation metrics and market perception.

With no cap on crude realizations anymore (previously limited to $75 per barrel between July 2022 and November 2024), ONGC is poised to reap the full benefit of elevated prices. Furthermore, the removal of the windfall tax since December 2024 ensures a more profitable operating environment.

ONGC’s Share Price Movement and Market Outlook
The oil & natural gas corp ltd share price has reflected these macroeconomic tailwinds. Investors are eyeing the ongc share price live for momentum as earnings prospects improve. At present, the ongc nse ticker continues to see buying interest from institutional and retail investors alike, anticipating further upside in case crude remains above $70.

When you compare NSE ONGC to its historical valuations, the current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio remains moderate, reflecting a discounted valuation relative to potential earnings growth. In fact, the pe ratio of ONGC today is significantly lower than many peers in the energy sector, signaling a possible re-rating opportunity.

Key ONGC Share Metrics: A Quick Look
Here are some vital stats investors often track:

Market Cap : ₹3,17,400Cr
P/E Ratio(TTM) : 8.76
P/B Ratio : 0.92
Industry P/E : 9.42
Debt to Equity : 0.55
ROE : 10.55%
EPS(TTM) : 28.80
Dividend Yield : 4.86%
Book Value : 273.00
Face Value : 5
Government Policy and Fiscal Stability
A key catalyst behind the current bullishness in oil and natural gas corporation ltd share price is policy reform. The Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Bill, 2024, recently passed by the Indian government, ensures fiscal stability for companies in the exploration and production (E&P) segment. This move aims to attract foreign and private investment while supporting domestic players like ONGC.

The absence of a windfall tax, combined with this new bill, positions ONGC for long-term growth. Analysts believe it reduces uncertainty and boosts confidence in the company’s cash flow sustainability.

Future Outlook: ONGC Share Future and Expansion Plans
Looking ahead, ONGC’s strategic roadmap involves expanding its reserves, improving output efficiency, and leveraging its international arm—ONGC Videsh Limited. While the ongc videsh limited share price isn’t separately listed, its contribution to consolidated earnings cannot be ignored.

Moreover, ONGC’s stake in refineries like MRPL, along with its growing interest in renewable energy, indicates a forward-looking diversification approach. These moves could influence the ONGC share future, making it not just a crude oil play, but a broader energy investment.

Sectoral Trends and Peer Comparison
While ONGC and Oil India stand to gain from high crude prices, downstream oil marketing companies (OMCs) like IOCL, BPCL, and HPCL face margin pressure. BPCL remains on ‘Hold’ due to relatively higher valuations.

This reinforces ONGC’s unique position in the oil ecosystem. As an upstream company, it benefits from rising crude, whereas OMCs suffer due to squeezed margins from higher input costs.

Market Sentiment and Retail Interest
Retail interest in PSU stocks has surged lately. Investors searching for "today's share price of ONGC" and "ONGC share price live today" have increased significantly, reflecting a growing appetite for blue-chip energy stocks. While high oil prices bring broader market concerns like inflation and fiscal deficit, they act as strong tailwinds for ONGC specifically.

Additionally, energy ETFs and mutual funds have been steadily accumulating ONGC shares, which has supported volumes on both BSE and NSE. This momentum can help the stock break through its resistance zones and potentially retest the ONGC highest share price levels seen in past bull cycles.

Should You Buy ONGC at Current Levels?
At the current valuation, ONGC appears to be a value buy. Here’s why:

Strong earnings visibility from high crude prices
No windfall tax dampening profitability
Positive policy environment with fiscal assurances
Attractive dividend yield due to strong cash flow
Low ONGC PE ratio today versus sector peers
However, investors must keep in mind that ONGC's fortunes are tightly correlated with crude oil. Any sharp correction in global prices or demand slowdown can impact performance. Therefore, one must keep an eye on geopolitical risks, demand forecasts, and OPEC+ decisions.

IPO to Present Day: ONGC’s Journey
The ONGC IPO price back in 2004 was ₹750 per share (before stock split and bonuses). Adjusted for splits and dividends, it has given consistent returns and remains a cornerstone of India's PSU portfolio. From then to now, the oil and natural gas corporation share price NSE has reflected the country’s energy demand and policy evolution.

As of 2025, ONGC remains one of the few companies balancing commercial viability and national strategic importance. This dual mandate makes it an essential part of India’s energy independence strategy.

What About Ambition Mica?
You may have noticed investor interest in Ambition Mica share price lately. However, unlike ONGC, Ambition Mica belongs to the decorative laminates segment. Its fundamentals, market risk, and earnings profile are vastly different. It serves as an alternative small-cap play, but lacks the scale, stability, and strategic importance that ONGC commands.

Investors comparing ONGC NSE to small-caps like Ambition Mica must factor in risk appetite, sector dynamics, and long-term value creation potential.

Final Word
In conclusion, the ONGC ltd share price is currently reflecting a bullish undertone due to the macro support of high crude oil prices, pro-business government policy, and improving investor sentiment. While short-term volatility due to global conflicts or OPEC decisions is possible, the long-term trajectory for ONGC appears optimistic.

For those seeking value, stability, and an attractive dividend yield in a volatile market, ONGC shares could be worth a deeper look. Always align your investment decision with your risk profile and consult a certified financial advisor.
